## Project 4 - Wrangling and Analyzing Data - "WeRateDogs"
### by Karine Legrand

### from the "Data Analyst Nanodegree Program" - Udacity Certificate

#### This project focused on aquiring fundamental skills in <i>Data Wrangling</i>. The Dataset chosen, comes from a popular Tweeter Account "WeRateDogs", sharing and "rating" Dogs' Pictures sent by their owner. After wrangling the data, we identifyied a few variables of interest and conducted an analysis, to try and find out if and how they influenced the popularity of the tweets. Finally, we gathered our results and documented them in two reports, one focusing on the <i>Wrangling</i> work and the second, on our <i>Exploratory Analysis</i>.

#### <u>Learning goals and achieved tasks:</u>
 - aquiring data, according to different common scenarios: importing CSV files, programmatically downloading files (with the <i>requests</i> python library) and querying an API (here using the <i>tweepy</i> wrapper to the Twitter API and the <i>json</i> library to process the responses obtained)
 - assessing the data (using numpy and pandas libraries), to identify <i>Quality and Tidiness Issues</i>
 - cleaning the data, following the <i>Define, Clean, Test</i> process and using the pandas and regex libraries, for tasks such as:
  * merging Dataframes
  * apply custom defined functions on specific columns
  * parsing text with regular expressions  
 - conducting an analysis on cleaned data by asking questions on variables of interest and answering those questions with descriptive Statistics Methods and Data Visualizations

#### <u>Files provided:</u><br><br>The 2 following reports extract and expose the main pieces of work:<br>In _"wrangle_report.ipynb"_, presents the main wrangling steps as well as the biggest challenges encountered, while _"act_report.ipynb"_ brings a summary of the most interesting findings of the Analysis I conducted.
#### All the steps taken in this project are detailed in the jupyter notebook _"wrangle_act.ipynb"_.
#### The review from a Udacity mentor, is included in _"mentor_review.pdf"_, validating that the project passed successfully for certification.
